Quiz using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and SASS.

When the quiz is submitted, an eventListener collects the value's of the radio buttons. If statements add up the global variable score of the quiz based on the value of each question. Then assigns a message to the modal calucated off of the score.

I love camping & backpacking so I thought it would be fun to make this quiz. I hope you enjoy taking it & find the answers fun.
